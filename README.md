# socialConnect
It is a full fledged social networking site equipped with chat system, avatar loading, 
photo loading and much more implemented in PHP and database used Mysql. Created by rahulmehra.

Notes from ScottDonor:
This script does not currently support password salting etc, use at your own risk. It seems like rahulmehra was implenting it but has not fully done so yet so that is on my to do list once I get more confortable with the script and it's coding. The main reason for my fork was to fix the status issues. This script has a lot of potential tho.

12/12/2016 Edited tablecreator.php file to add a DEFAULT value in the status table, osid field. Status commenting should now work.

Scotts TO DO list:
See if I can get salting to work.
Add mysql error handling to all querys.
Fix forgot password page and edit the link on login.php.
Make the code more NEWBIE friendly. (Since I'm a NEWB!)
